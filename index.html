      <div>
        <p class="para-1">The question of what causes people to lose their lives is of paramount importance, guiding critical decisions in public health and ultimately saving lives. Sadly, many of the leading causes of death often remain in the shadows, receiving insufficient public attention. Over time, the death rates stemming from these causes have witnessed significant incline on a global scale. Hence, it is crucial to take into a deeper understanding of the root casues of mortality that fall across the population. This exploration aims to shed light on the leading causes of death in 2019, with a specific focus on environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle factors.

            It is obvious that there is a <em>positive correlation</em> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) between death rates due to high systolic blood pressure and diets high in sodium. Notably, the size of the data points <em>increases proportionally</em> with higher death rates associated with both high systolic blood pressure and high sodium intake.  This suggests a strong likelihood that individuals who succumb to high glucose consumption are also at risk of succumbing to high systolic blood pressure.

          <br> 
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Zooming in on specific countries, such as <em_high_l>Malaysia</em_high_l> and <em_high_l>Australia</em_high_l>, further illuminates the disparities. Malaysia exhibits a <bi_l>higher death rate</bi_l> attributed to both high systolic blood pressure and high sodium diets compared to Australia. Additionally, Malaysia reports a slightly higher death rate due to high fasting plasma glucose levels than Australia.

The bar chart on the left illustrates the <em_high_l>top 10</em_high_l> countries with the highest death rates attributed to diets low in plant-based sources in 2019. Plant-based sources include whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds, as well as vegetables.

        <p class="para-1"> This exploration delves into the profound influence of distinct risk factor categories on death rates, with a specific focus on environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle factors. Environmental risks, encompassing factors like air pollution and unsafe water sources, have the potential to contribute significantly to elevated mortality rates. Nutritional factors, particularly the adoption of balanced diets, play a pivotal role in preventing waterborne diseases and ensuring overall health. Furthermore, lifestyle choices, including habits like smoking, drug use, and alcohol addiction, exert a substantial impact on mortality rates. This deep understanding of how these factors are interconnected provides us with valuable insights to develop effective strategies in public health for reducing preventable deaths.
