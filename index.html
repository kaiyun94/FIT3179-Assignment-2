        <p class="para-1">The question of what causes people to lose their lives is of paramount importance, guiding critical decisions in public health and ultimately saving lives. Sadly, many of the leading causes of death often remain in the shadows, receiving insufficient public attention. Over time, the death rates stemming from these causes have witnessed significant incline on a global scale. Hence, it is crucial to take into a deeper understanding of the root casues of mortality that fall across the age group.

            From the bubble plot on the right, it is obvious that there is a <em>positive correlation</em> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) between death rates due to high systolic blood pressure and diets high in sodium. Notably, the size of the data points <em>increases proportionally</em> with higher death rates associated with both high systolic blood pressure and high sodium intake.  This suggests a strong likelihood that individuals who succumb to high glucose consumption are also at risk of succumbing to high systolic blood pressure.

            Zooming in on specific countries, such as <em_purple_xl>Malaysia</em_purple_xl> and <em_brown_xl>Australia</em_brown_xl>, further illuminates the disparities. Malaysia exhibits a <em_purple_i>higher death rate</em_purple_i> attributed to both high systolic blood pressure and high sodium diets compared to Australia. Additionally, Malaysia reports a slightly higher death rate due to high fasting plasma glucose levels than Australia.

          Now, let's take a closer look at the relationship between diet and death rates. The bar chart on the left illustrates the <em_high_l>top 10</em_high_l> countries with the highest death rates attributed to diets low in plant-based sources in 2019. Plant-based sources include whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds, as well as vegetables.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
          Surprisingly, more than half of the countries on this list are located in <em_blue_l>Europe</em_blue_l>, with <em_blue_xl>Ukraine</em_blue_xl> claiming the top spot with a notably high average death rate of 288.65 per 100,000 people. It is worth noting that the <em>global average death rate</em> in this context stands at <em>57.37</em> per 100,000 people, putting these figures into perspective and highlighting the significance of dietary choices in influencing health outcomes worldwide.

          When examining diet practices on a global scale, it becomes evident that <em_high_l>diets low in vegetables</em_high_l> tend to be associated with <em_high>higher</em_high> death rates compared to other dietary habits.

Here, we observe a consistent pattern: low vegetable consumption is consistently linked to higher death rates, while diets low in nuts and seeds are associated with the lowest death rates. Interestingly, low diet in fruit and low diet in whole grain show similar effects on death rates in both of these continents.

        <p class="para-1"> This exploration delves into the profound influence of distinct risk factor categories on death rates, with a specific focus on environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle factors. Environmental risks, encompassing factors like air pollution and unsafe water sources, have the potential to contribute significantly to elevated mortality rates. Nutritional factors, particularly the adoption of balanced diets, play a pivotal role in preventing waterborne diseases and ensuring overall health. Furthermore, lifestyle choices, including habits like smoking, drug use, and alcohol addiction, exert a substantial impact on mortality rates. This deep understanding of how these factors are interconnected provides us with valuable insights to develop effective strategies in public health for reducing preventable deaths.
